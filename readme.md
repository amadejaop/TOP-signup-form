### Project description
This is a mock sign up form created using front-end technologies only!
The form accepts a first name between 3 and 10 characters, a last name between 3 and 20 characters, a phone number, an email address as well as password and password confirmation.
Whether the two passwords match or not is tested using JavaScript. Upon entering a password inside the confirm password field that does not match the password field, an error message is displayed.
